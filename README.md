# ROBUST
Add Description

## Transformers

A series of transformers that calculate collective variables from molecular dynamics simulations.
These transformers were developed for use with [Schrodingers Protein-Ligand Database](https://www.schrodinger.com/pldb) however, they can also be called from the command line or imported in python.

An example is shown in the examples/DHFR.


## Examples

1. DHFR

## Requirements

ROBUST Transformers utilizes the [Schrodinger Python Api](https://www.schrodinger.com/pythonapi) to parse and process molecular dynamics simulations. Transformers have been tested with Schrodinger v.18.1 and v.19.1 . Data analysis examples do not require schrodigner and only have to meet the python dependencies.
